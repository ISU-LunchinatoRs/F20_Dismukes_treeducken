# F20_Dismukes_treeducken
Repo for demonstrating `treeducken` for the lunchinators R group at Iowa State.


To get started please install `treeducken`. I recommend the CRAN version using:

```
install.packages("treeducken")
```

Alternatively, if you are a gambler you can download the development version from the github repo:

```
devtools::install_github("wadedismukes/treeducken")
```
